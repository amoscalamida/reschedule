Students:
---------
As Student you can manage multiple Changes in so called Projects. This is especially useful if you plan to reschedule multiple Lessons for the same reason.

**Create a Project**:
Press the "New Project" Button on the bottom left side of the Table. Enter a Title (only you can see this) and provide a Reason for the Changes (This helps the Secretary determine whether to allow or decline your request and ist therefor very important).

**Create Changes**:
A Change can be added via the "New Changes" Button on the bottom left side of the Changes Table in the Projects' Detail View.
